## Introduction to Computer Science - CS 164- Drexel University

This was my "Introduction to Computer Science" class ain Fall- 2018, Drexel University. 
This cousrse focused on computing logics and introduced me to HTML, JavaScript and CSS. The files included here are some of the modified versions of the homework that I played around to know more about designing web pages.

* A calendar Generator- Website that generates a full-month calendar once we input the year and month.
* A Interactive state machine that automatcally changes its state in specific time intervals.

These files and code can be used by anyone to learn or look for beginner reference.
